This is a collection of LaTeX write-ups for mathematical ideas and such that interest me at the time written. This is like a blog/dump of mathy things, but in paper format. Thanks for reading!

**WARNING:** There is no guarantee of correctness. The priority is clarity in writing, but even that is also not guaranteed ðŸ˜©.
