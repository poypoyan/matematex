This is a collection of LaTeX write-ups for mathematical ideas that interest me at the time written. This is like a *blog* of math, but in paper format and less freshed out. Thanks for reading!

**WARNING:** There is no guarantee of correctness. The priority is clarity in writing, but even that is also not guaranteed ðŸ˜©.
